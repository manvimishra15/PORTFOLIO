# PORTFOLIO
My first-ever web project, built during my first year as a way to explore HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. This portfolio reflects a subtle, cute, and animated style, combining creativity with my early journey into web development. It represents both my learning process and my personality as I started building for the web.
